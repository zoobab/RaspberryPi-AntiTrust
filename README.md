A playbook to make SBC's in the maker community more accessible.

**Why?**
- They as a charity, relinquished control of all system updates, of their primary product, to a foreign third-party company
  - that coincidentally paid them over $500,000 euros last year.
- They did so without announcement or user consent, going as far as to silence whisle blowers
- They secretly ousted corporate whistle-blowers
- They took no community input in that decision

# Playbook

- [ ] Rename to UK SBC
- [ ] Keyword block on SM
- [ ] Lobby for import bans as a threat to National Security
- [ ] Abandon or shift all community support to ARM SBC's generically
- [ ] Lawsuits in GPL, GDPR, CCPA
