# RaspberryPi-antitrust

A playbook to make SBC's in the maker community more accessible.

Why?
- They reliquished control of all system updates to a company
  - that coincidentally paid them over $500,000 euros last year.
- They did so without announcement or user consent, going as far as to silence whisle blowers
- They secretly ousted corporate whistle-blowers
- They took no community input in that decision


- [ ] Rename to UK SBC
- [ ] Keyword block on SM
- [ ] Lobby for import bans as a threat to National Security
- [ ] Abandon or shift all community support to ARM SBC's generically
- [ ] Lawsuits in GPL, GDPR, CCPA
